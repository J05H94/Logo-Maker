# Logo-Maker

In this project, we made a logo maker. This is perfect for someone wanting a simple placeholder three letter logo. A user is prompted to select a shape, enter a color or hexadecimal value for it, the three letters to enter, and a color for the text. A svg file is then made with the logo.
